Whom did she murder?”</p><p>“Why, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name,” said Herbert, “but, she was tried for it, and Mr. Jaggers defended her, and the reputation of that defence first made his name known to Provis. It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim, and there had been a struggle—in a barn. Who began it, or how fair it was, or how unfair, may be doubtful; but how it ended is certainly not doubtful, for the victim was found throttled.”</p><p>“Was the woman brought in guilty?”</p><p>“No; she was acquitted.—My poor Handel, I hurt you!”</p><p>“It is impossible to be gentler, Herbert.
