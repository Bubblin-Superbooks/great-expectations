This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept together by the Nation, after my son's time, for the people's enjoyment.”</p><p>“You're as proud of it as Punch; ain't you, Aged?” said Wemmick, contemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened; “<em>there's</em> a nod for you;” giving him a tremendous one; “<em>there's</em> another for you;” giving him a still more tremendous one; “you like that, don't you? If you're not tired, Mr. Pip—though I know it's tiring to strangers—will you tip him one more? You can't think how it pleases him.”</p><p>I tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits.
