Mr. Pumblechook stood over me and poured out my tea—before I could touch the teapot—with the air of a benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.</p><p>“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, “put the salt on.

William, bring a watercress.”</p><p>“Thank you,” said I, shortly, “but I don't eat watercresses.”</p><p>“You don't eat 'em,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding his head several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. “True. The simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn't bring any, William.”</p></div> </div>
