The cast was made in Newgate, directly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy for me, hadn't you, Old Artful?” said Wemmick. He then explained this affectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the lady and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying, “Had it made for me, express!”</p><p>“Is the lady anybody?” said I.</p><p>“No,” returned Wemmick. “Only his game. (You liked your bit of game, didn't you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except one,—and she wasn't of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn't have caught <em>her</em> looking after this urn, unless there was something to drink in it.” Wemmick's attention being thus directed to his brooch, he put down the cast, and polished the brooch with his pocket-handkerchief.</p></div> </div>
